# About Me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Brant Beverly, a college student at University of Utah studying Computer Science with an emphasis in game design (which they formally call Entertainment Arts Engineering). I have several projects showcased on this website, spanning different aspects of both coding and game design. I often enjoy working on small projects and ideas as to learn what I can accomplish with my current abilities and further my breadth and depth of knowledge in a variety of topics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently working on self-publishing my boardgame prototype online along with potential further development and developing future game projects including both boardgames and videogames, along with other coding projects as I think of them.
