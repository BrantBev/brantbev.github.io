The game focusses on the bond between the dog you play as and your ghostly cat companion and the many unique puzzles that can be created within this space. This is emphasized throughout the game by having each puzzle involve both maneuvering with the dog and interacting with far away items via the dog.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My focus throughout the development of the game was the creation of the core gameplay systems allowing each puzzle to be built by the designers without engineer assistance. This ranged from tracking the cursor and making it so the cat could click on objects, to creating simple interactible for both the dog and cat, and to allowing designers the ability to set movements and interactions easily without requiring custom code for each simple action. This task began early and most of these frameworks to be in place before further development, so that the designers knew what they could work with and design around. Afterwards I worked on implementing new systems and expanding those existing systems based on new ideas designers had, enabling more interesting and unique levels.
